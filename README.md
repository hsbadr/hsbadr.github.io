Today, there are many skilled and talented scientists applying their abilities to solve challenging problems of their field and contributing to the scientific literature. It is rare, however, to find interdisciplinary scientists who dynamically combine multiple disciplines, creative ideas, and innovative approaches to solve complex real-world problems using machine learning and numerical simulations. I am an applied scientist with broad and in-depth skills and more than two decades of experience in statistical analysis, numerical modeling of physical processes, data visualization, and software engineering as well as project management and leadership. I am a language-agnostic software developer who can easily and quickly switch between different platforms and master new solutions. I am trained first in aerospace engineering and earth sciences, and I have developed my skills in software engineering, mathematics, statistics, machine learning, and physics to address grand challenges in aerodynamics, hydroclimate, infectious diseases, global health, and business intelligence.
